Hello! I'm Tom, a physics researcher and programmer with 5+ years lab experience working with precision optical measurements, semiconductor characterization, electronics, crystal growth, and theoretical calculations/simulations. I have further interest in expanding my research portfolio in the fields of semiconductor manufacturing, non-linear optics, quantum computing, laser design, and machine learning.
